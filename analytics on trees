# First, we'll start by loading the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Next, we'll read in the data from a CSV file
tree_data <- read_csv("tree_data.csv")

# Now we'll perform some data cleaning
# Let's start by removing any rows with missing values
tree_data <- tree_data %>% drop_na()

# We can also check for and remove any duplicate rows
tree_data <- tree_data %>% distinct()

# Now let's take a look at the summary statistics for the data
summary(tree_data)

# Let's visualize the data to see if there are any patterns or trends
ggplot(data = tree_data, aes(x = height, y = diameter)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Height vs. Diameter of Trees",
       x = "Height (ft)",

# We can also use the group_by() and summarize() functions to calculate summary statistics for different groups within the data
tree_data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height),
            mean_diameter = mean(diameter))

# Finally, we can use the lm() function to fit a linear model to the data and examine the model summary
lm_fit <- lm(diameter ~ height, data = tree_data)
